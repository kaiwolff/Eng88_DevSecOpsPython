#Built in methods available that give us boolean outcome
#e.g.

name = "James"
#isalpha checks if all the character are letters
print(name.isalpha())

#if this was a number, would need to use casting:

# age = str(2)
# print(age.isalpha())
print(name[0])
print(name.startswith(name[0].upper()))
