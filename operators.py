# example_text = "here's SOME text, with a lot of text inside."
# print(example_text.count("text")) #counts how many times the argument stringis in the target string

# #other ways of messign around with text.
# print(example_text.lower()) # makes everythign lower case
# print(example_text.upper()) # makes everything upper case
# print(example_text.capitalize()) # capitalises the first letter of the string.

#exercise: converst age string into integer, print out age as integer and type
print("{}, {}".format(int(age), type(int(age))))

#can also do
int_age = int(age)
print("{}, {}".format(int_age, type(int_age)))
#also
print(f"{int(age)}, {type(int(age))}")
