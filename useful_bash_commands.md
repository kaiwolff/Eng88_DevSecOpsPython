#The Command Line/Terminal
I will be updating this as we come across bash commands, should anyone make requests about a particular command. You can also Google the command or use the built in manual pages.
###What it is:
Basically, a way of issuing commands to you computer. We are using bash (Bourne Again Shell) commands generally. While it is fiddly at first, it has a lot of options and tools available, and a lot of servers can only be interacted with using the command line


##Useful Commands

###Moving Around
**ls** - short for "list". Lists the directory you are in.
**cd** - short for "change directory". Add a file path to change to that directory


**rm** -> short for "remove". removes files.

**mkdir** -> short for "make directory"

**cd** - short for "change directory". Add a file path

##General terms:
- OPTIONS - these are added after a command and tell it to do something specific. Sometimes called flags.
