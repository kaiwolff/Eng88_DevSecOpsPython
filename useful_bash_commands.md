# The Command Line/Terminal
I will be updating this as we come across bash commands, should anyone make requests about a particular command. You can also Google the command or use the built in manual pages.
### What it is:
Basically, a way of issuing commands to you computer. We are using bash (Bourne Again Shell) commands generally. While it is fiddly at first, it has a lot of options and tools available, and a lot of servers can only be interacted with using the command line

## Useful Commands

**ls** - short for "list". Lists the directory you are in.
**cd** - short for "change directory". Add a file path to change to that directory
**rm** - short for "remove". removes files.
**mkdir** - short for "make directory"
**cd** - short for "change directory". Add a file path
**cp** - short for "copy". copies a file at a given location to another location

## General terms:
- Options - these are added after a command and tell it to do something specific. Sometimes called flags.
- Arguments - these are required by some commands to work. For example, ``cp`` requires the filepath of the file/s you are copying and the filepatch where the copies should be placed.
